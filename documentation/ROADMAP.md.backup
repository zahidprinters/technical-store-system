## 📝 Implementation Strategy

### Development Approach
1. **One Feature at a Time** - Complete each DocType fully before moving to next
2. **Test Thoroughly** - Unit tests, integration tests, user acceptance
3. **Document Everything** - Update docs as features are added
4. **User Feedback** - Collect feedback after each phase
5. **Iterate** - Refine based on real-world usage

### Best Practices
- Follow Frappe Framework conventions
- Use setup-based architecture (no JSON unless exported)
- Maintain clean code structure (controllers, helpers, validators)
- Write meaningful commit messages
- Keep documentation in sync with code
- Use demo data for testing

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All features tested manually
- [ ] No console errors
- [ ] Documentation updated
- [ ] Demo data includes examples
- [ ] Migration tested on fresh site
- [ ] User training materials prepared
